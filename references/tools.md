## gbp

Use `gbp` as the default repository-aware entrypoint. Always inspect existing config before assuming branch names, tags, builder, pristine-tar, or tarball location:

```bash
gbp config dump
gbp buildpackage --help
```

Common build commands:

```bash
gbp buildpackage
gbp buildpackage --git-pbuilder
gbp buildpackage --git-builder=sbuild
gbp buildpackage --git-tag-only
gbp buildpackage --git-ignore-new
```

Avoid `--git-ignore-new` for upload-prep unless the user explicitly wants to include uncommitted changes in a local test build. It can hide unreproducible state.

## User Default: gbp With pbuilder

This user usually configures `gbp` to build via pbuilder. Prefer reading config and invoking the existing gbp flow rather than calling `pdebuild` directly.

Typical commands:

```bash
gbp buildpackage --git-pbuilder
gbp buildpackage --git-pbuilder --git-arch=amd64 --git-dist=sid
DIST=unstable ARCH=amd64 git-pbuilder create
DIST=unstable ARCH=amd64 git-pbuilder update
DIST=unstable ARCH=amd64 gbp buildpackage --git-pbuilder
```

For this user, the most common local build command is:

```bash
gbp buildpackage --git-pbuilder --git-arch=amd64 --git-dist=sid
```

Prefer this exact command for amd64 sid test builds unless the package or task requires another architecture or suite. Treat `sid` and `unstable` as equivalent in Debian suite naming, but preserve the user's command spelling when documenting or rerunning.

If a pbuilder chroot is missing or stale, ask before creating/updating it because that may require root, network, and writes outside the workspace.

## sbuild

Use sbuild when the repository or maintainer workflow expects it, when matching Debian buildd behavior matters, or when autopkgtest/sbuild chroots are already configured.

Typical commands:

```bash
sbuild -A -s -v
sbuild --no-clean-source
gbp buildpackage --git-builder=sbuild
```

Do not assume schroot/unshare backend names. Inspect local config (`~/.sbuildrc`, available chroots) when needed.

## pbuilder

pbuilder builds packages in a clean chroot. It is useful for local reproducibility and dependency sanity. In this user's workflow, prefer gbp's pbuilder integration where possible.

Common direct commands:

```bash
pbuilder create --distribution unstable
pbuilder update --distribution unstable
pbuilder build ../package_version.dsc
pdebuild
```

Use direct pbuilder only if gbp integration is not available or the user asks for it.

## uscan And Upstream Imports

Use `uscan` to check upstream releases from `debian/watch`:

```bash
uscan --report
uscan --download-current-version
gbp import-orig --uscan
gbp import-orig ../upstream.tar.*
```

For new upstream releases, preserve the repository's branch/tag model and pristine-tar setting. Check `debian/watch`, upstream signing, repacks, Files-Excluded, and copyright changes before declaring the import ready.

## pristine-tar

When `gbp.conf` has `pristine-tar = True`, treat pristine-tar as part of the source package state. The `pristine-tar` branch stores the data needed to reconstruct the exact upstream tarball from the upstream branch plus delta metadata.

Common checks:

```bash
git branch --list '*pristine-tar*'
git config --get gbp.pristine-tar
gbp config dump
```

Common import/build patterns:

```bash
gbp import-orig --uscan --pristine-tar
gbp import-orig ../package_version.orig.tar.* --pristine-tar
gbp buildpackage --git-pristine-tar
```

Do not delete or regenerate pristine-tar history casually. If an upstream tarball was repacked, check `debian/copyright` `Files-Excluded`, `debian/watch`, and the orig tarball name before importing. If the tarball cannot be reproduced, report that as a release-blocking packaging issue rather than forcing an unrelated tarball.

## gbp dch

Use `gbp dch` to generate a changelog draft from git history, then edit it as maintainer-facing release notes.

Useful patterns:

```bash
gbp dch
gbp dch --since=<commit-or-tag>
gbp dch --debian-branch=<branch>
gbp dch --release
```

After running `gbp dch`, always review and edit `debian/changelog`; do not treat generated commit subjects as final changelog text. Add `Closes: #NNNNNN` manually where the release actually closes Debian bugs.

## quilt And Patch Queues

For `3.0 (quilt)` packages, maintain patches cleanly:

```bash
quilt push -a
quilt pop -a
quilt new fix-name.patch
quilt add path/to/file
editor path/to/file
quilt diff
quilt refresh
quilt header -e
quilt pop -a
```

With gbp patch queues:

```bash
gbp pq import
gbp pq export
gbp pq drop
```

Use whichever model the repository already uses. When adding patches, include DEP-3 metadata unless the repository's practice is clearly different.

Quilt rules that avoid corrupt patch stacks:

- Push all patches before editing if the change depends on current patched source.
- Use `quilt add` before modifying each file so the patch records the correct delta.
- Use `quilt refresh` only for the intended top patch; check `quilt top` first.
- Use `quilt diff` before refresh and `git diff debian/patches` after refresh.
- Keep `.pc/` untracked and do not manually edit it.
- Keep `debian/patches/series` ordered and deterministic.
- Prefer `quilt header -e` for DEP-3 metadata so refreshes preserve the header.
- After patch work, run `quilt pop -a` and confirm `dpkg-source --before-build .` can reapply patches.

Patch filename convention: use short lowercase names with hyphens and `.patch`, for example `fix-ftbfs-gcc-16.patch`. Avoid names that encode temporary bug theories.

When editing an existing patch:

```bash
quilt push -a
quilt top
quilt files
quilt add <additional-file-if-needed>
editor <file>
quilt diff
quilt refresh
quilt header -e
```

## devscripts Helpers

Useful commands:

```bash
dch
debchange
debuild
debsign
debrelease
debdiff
debc
debi
wrap-and-sort
mk-build-deps
```

Use helper tools to reduce formatting mistakes, but review the diff because they can reorder or rewrite packaging files extensively.
