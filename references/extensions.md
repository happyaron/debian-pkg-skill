## Possible Future Reference Files

Split these out when enough concrete tasks accumulate:

- `references/python.md`: pybuild, dh-sequence-python3, autopkgtest-pkg-pybuild, pytest, PEP 517.
- `references/rust.md`: debcargo, crate updates, vendoring, feature flags.
- `references/go.md`: dh-golang, Built-Using, vendoring, module paths.
- `references/c-library.md`: symbols files, shlibs, Multi-Arch, transitions.
- `references/kernel.md`: DKMS, module signing, linux-support packages.
- `references/debusine.md`: concrete CLI/API workflows once local credentials and usage patterns are known.

## Maintainer Heuristics

- Prefer archive consistency over upstream convenience.
- Prefer testable minimal diffs over broad modernization.
- Preserve team-maintained style even if another style is personally preferred.
- Make networked or privileged operations explicit.
- Keep external service links in the final summary when they informed the work.
