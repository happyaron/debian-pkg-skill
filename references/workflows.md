# Debian Packaging Workflows

## Bug Fix In Debian Packaging

1. Read the BTS report, package tracker, and Salsa MRs/issues.
2. Reproduce locally if possible with the package's normal build/test path.
3. Decide whether the fix belongs in Debian packaging, upstream source, dependencies, or tests.
4. For upstream source in `3.0 (quilt)`, add or update a quilt patch with DEP-3 headers.
5. Update `debian/changelog` with a concise entry and `Closes: #NNNNNN` if appropriate.
6. Run focused validation, then full build/autopkgtest if the fix affects runtime behavior.

For quilt patches, use this default sequence:

```bash
quilt push -a
quilt new fix-specific-issue.patch
quilt add path/to/file
editor path/to/file
quilt diff
quilt refresh
quilt header -e
quilt pop -a
dpkg-source --before-build .
```

The patch header must explain provenance and forwarding state. Use `Forwarded: not-needed` only for genuinely Debian-specific changes; otherwise use `Forwarded: no` until the patch is sent upstream.

## New Upstream Release

1. Check tracker, watch file, upstream changelog, current Debian delta, and open bugs.
2. Run `uscan --report`; use `gbp import-orig --uscan` if the repository supports it.
3. If `pristine-tar = True`, import with pristine-tar enabled and verify the orig tarball is reproducible.
4. Refresh/drop Debian patches; forward remaining patches upstream where possible.
5. Review copyright and license changes.
6. Review build system changes and dependencies.
7. Generate a changelog draft with `gbp dch`, then edit it into release notes and add `Closes:` entries.
8. Run clean build, lintian, and autopkgtest.
9. Update changelog as `<upstream>-1` unless Debian versioning requires otherwise.

Common command sequence:

```bash
uscan --report
gbp import-orig --uscan --pristine-tar
quilt push -a
quilt refresh
quilt pop -a
gbp dch
editor debian/changelog
gbp buildpackage --git-pbuilder --git-arch=amd64 --git-dist=sid
```

Drop `--pristine-tar` only when the repository does not use pristine-tar.

## Packaging-Only Revision

Use for metadata, dependency, test, or packaging fixes with no upstream version change.

1. Increment Debian revision with `dch`.
2. Keep changes under `debian/` unless a quilt patch is required.
3. Commit each logical change with a changelog-ready subject, for example `d/control: add missing build dependency on foo`.
4. Use `gbp dch` when the packaging branch has meaningful commits to summarize.
5. Edit `debian/changelog` to remove commit noise and add accurate `Closes:` entries.
6. Validate with source build and relevant QA.
7. Avoid unrelated standards/version churn.

## Commit Before Changelog Generation

Before running `gbp dch`, review recent commit subjects:

```bash
git log --oneline <last-upload-tag>..HEAD
```

The subjects should be good raw material for changelog entries. If they are vague, mixed-purpose, or too implementation-heavy, prefer fixing/squashing local commits before generating the changelog when history is still private. Do not rewrite shared history without explicit maintainer approval.

Suggested commit granularity:

- one commit for a dependency/control change
- one commit for a quilt patch add/remove/refresh set
- one commit for autopkgtest changes
- one commit for symbols/install/rules metadata updates
- one release commit for final `gbp dch`/upload changelog state when repository practice uses it

## NMU

Non-maintainer uploads require extra care.

1. Confirm the bug severity and NMU appropriateness in Developer's Reference.
2. Keep the diff minimal.
3. Use NMU versioning, usually `+nmu1` for non-native packages.
4. Include changelog entries that clearly identify the fixed bug.
5. Respect DELAYED queue conventions unless an immediate upload is justified.

## FTBFS

1. Collect failing build log, architecture, suite, build profile, and dependency versions.
2. Try reproducing in clean pbuilder/sbuild matching the failure.
3. Distinguish missing Build-Depends from upstream/compiler/toolchain breakage.
4. Patch with the smallest change and include upstream forwarding status.
5. Validate at least a source build and clean binary build.

Compiler/toolchain fixes often belong upstream. If the patch is backported from upstream, set `Origin: upstream` or `Origin: backport`; if created in Debian, include `Bug-Debian` and forward it upstream when practical.

## Autopkgtest Regression

1. Read `debian/tests/control`, failing logs, triggered packages, and testbed architecture.
2. Reproduce with the same backend if possible; use `null` only for quick local checks.
3. Determine whether the regression is in the package, a dependency, test assumptions, or infrastructure.
4. Prefer fixing the package/test over adding broad restrictions.
5. If adding `Restrictions`, document why the test genuinely requires them.

## Library Transition

1. Identify ABI/API change, reverse dependencies, and release team coordination needs.
2. Update symbols/shlibs carefully; compare build logs and generated files.
3. Avoid breaking coinstallability or multiarch metadata.
4. Consider binNMUs and transition tracker state before upload.

## Pre-Upload Checklist

Run or explicitly defer:

```bash
git status --short
dpkg-parsechangelog
gbp config dump
gbp buildpackage --git-pbuilder --git-arch=amd64 --git-dist=sid
lintian ../*.changes
autopkgtest ../*.dsc -- <backend>
```

Check:

- changelog distribution is correct, not `UNRELEASED`
- version is correct for target suite
- bug closures are intended
- source format and patch stack are clean
- generated files are cleaned
- Vcs fields point to the active repository
- test failures and lintian findings are understood
